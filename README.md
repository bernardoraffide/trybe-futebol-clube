# Welcome to the Trybe Futebol Clube repository!

# Technologies

The Front-end was already done by Trybe, so i'll focus in the stacks i practiced in the Back-end development, which is:

- Typescript
- Nodejs
- Docker 
- MySQL
- Sequelize
- Express
- Chai & Sinon (tests) 
- bcrypt


# Starting the app

To see the both Back-end & Front-end working together you'll need to follow these steps:

- Clone the repository in your machine
- Install the dependencies (npm i)
- Enter in app/backend and start the application (npm start)
- In a second terminal you'll enter in app/frontend and will also start the application (npm start) without shuting down the previous process.

# Contribuitions

- This is a project i made as a Trybe Student, and some codes were already done, such as the whole Front-end, lint stuff, the seeders and the db.example to populate the DB.
